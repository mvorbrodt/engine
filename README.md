# Vorbrodt's 3D Engine...
# ...or more like a half baked OpenGL 4.5 renderer :)

Few short recordings in the https://github.com/mvorbrodt/engine/tree/master/demos folder.

Result of 2 weeks of playing around with OpenGL 4.5, C++, Blender, and Assimp. Started with this little thing, was going to move onto deferred shading, physically-based rendering, and real-time ray-tracing, but just never got the time :o(
